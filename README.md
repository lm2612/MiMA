# Model of an idealized Moist Atmosphere (MiMA) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.597136.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.597136)
MiMA is an intermediate-complexity General Circulation Model with interactive water vapor and full radiation. It is published in

[M Jucker and EP Gerber, 2017: *Untangling the annual cycle of the tropical tropopause layer with an idealized moist model*, Journal of Climate 30, 7339-7358](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0127.1)

for v1.x and 

[Garfinkel et al. (2020): *The building blocks of Northern Hemisphere wintertime stationary waves*, Journal of Climate](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0181.1)

for v2.0.

Please see the documentation [online](http://mjucker.github.io/MiMA/) or [in the docs folder](docs/) for information about the model.

## Building for Machine Learning

### PyTorch
* Requires the fortran-pytorch library available [here](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/fortran-pytorch-lib)
* Build with: 

    cmake -DTorch_DIR=<Path-to-venv>/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Torc

* Build MiMA using:

### TensorFlow
* Requires the fortran-pytorch library available [here](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/fortran-tf-lib)
* Requires TensorFlow C API:

    FILENAME=libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64-2.11.0.tar.gz
    wget -q --no-check-certificate https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/${FILENAME}
    tar -C <PATH_TO_INSTALL_LOCATION> -xzf ${FILENAME}

* Build with:

    cmake .. -DTENSORFLOW_LOCATION=<PATH_TO_TF_C_API_INSTALL_LOCATION> -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

### Forpy
* Requires a python venv with TensorFlow/PyTorch (and any other requirements) installed.

### MiMA
* Build with 

    cmake -DFLAG_FOR_ML ..

where `-DFLAG_FOR_ML` is one of `-DBUILD_PT_COUPLING`, `-DBUILD_TF_COUPLING`, `-DBUILD_FORPY_COUPLING`
